The file fake_reactions.txt contains 6 cells. Cells (c1,c2,c3) and (c4,c5,c6) represent say th17n and th17p respectively, with distinct reaction scores.
The first 6 reactions have clear structure: they are 'overexpressed' in the first group.
Reactions 7 and 8 are weirdish reactions (I have seen one like this in the th17 dataset, with 289 zeros and one non-zero).
Reaction 9 is a constant reaction (around 1.5% are like this in the th17 dataset)
Reactions 10 through 12 are zero reactions (around 34% are like this in the th17 dataset).

The file fake_metadata.txt contains the metadata. Specifically, the type of each cell (Th17p or Th17n)
